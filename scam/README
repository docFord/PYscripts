This program will stuff fake credentials into phishing webpages in order to inconvenience them. 

The program requires that you enter the phishing url as well as the specific parameter 
names for that site when posting data. 

The hopes are to flood their datadumps with fake credentials so that they spend more time 
testing fake creds than actual credentials entered by duped persons. You can increase the 
sizes of the pw.json and names.json as you see fit as I only posted a snippet of 
the files I created.
